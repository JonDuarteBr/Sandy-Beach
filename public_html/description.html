                        Located north of Tortola and south of Jost Van Dyke, this is probably the most visited island in the world that has no 
                        man made structures. There's good snorkeling here, a fabulous palm lined beach, a nice nature trail and lots of sea birds. 
                        The lovely daytime anchorage can become quite rough when the swells are running. Please use caution if trying 
                        to land a dinghy on the beach when the swells are up. Ashore, if you decide to explore the trail, be sure to take your 
                        shoes. You'll be rewarded with marvelous views of surrounding islands, once atop the cliffs of the north shore. 
                        Donated in 2008 to the people of the BVI by the estate of philanthropist and conservationist, Laurance S. Rockefeller, 
                        Sandy Cay is now a National Park and protected wildlife sanctuary. In the mid 1700's, the island was owned by the 
                        Lettsom family of Little Jost Van Dyke and had been cleared for farming purposes. It is likely that cotton was 
                        grown here. Rockefeller had a deep seated love for this little 14 acre island and he personally spent a 
                        great deal of time and effort returning it to it's natural state by painstakingly re-planting indigenous 
                        plants to ensure the continued health of the local flora and fauna. The donation of the island to the people of 
                        the British Virgin Islands by the Rockefeller Foundation, was coupled with the understanding of the 
                        BVI government that it would immediately be declared a National Park and would remain a protected area in perpetuity
